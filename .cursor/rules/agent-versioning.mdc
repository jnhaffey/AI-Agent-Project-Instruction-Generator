# Agent Semantic Versioning Rules

When making changes to Agent instruction files, you MUST update the semantic version according to the type of change being made.

## Version Format
All Agent files use semantic versioning: `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

## Version Update Rules

### MAJOR Version (X.0.0)
Update the major version when making **breaking changes** that:
- Remove or significantly alter existing responsibilities
- Change the fundamental workflow or process
- Modify core agent interactions or handoff protocols
- Remove or rename major sections or capabilities

### MINOR Version (X.Y.0)
Update the minor version when making **feature additions** that:
- Add new responsibilities or capabilities
- Introduce new workflow steps or processes
- Add new sections or guidelines
- Enhance existing functionality without breaking changes
- Add new principles, rules, or methodologies

### PATCH Version (X.Y.Z)
Update the patch version when making **bug fixes or minor improvements** that:
- Fix typos or grammatical errors
- Clarify existing instructions without changing meaning
- Improve formatting or structure
- Add minor clarifications or examples
- Update references to other agents or files

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Update Agent File Version
- Update the version in the main heading: `# [Agent Name] Instructions vX.Y.Z`
- Update the version in the Role Overview section if referenced

### 2. Update README.md Version
- Update the corresponding agent version in the "Agent Ecosystem Components" section
- Ensure consistency between agent file and README versions

### 3. Commit Message Format
Include version information in commit messages:
```
[Agent Name] vX.Y.Z: [Description of changes]

- [Specific change 1]
- [Specific change 2]
- Updated version from vX.Y.Z to vX.Y.Z
```

## Examples

### Major Version Update
```
# Software Engineer Agent Instructions v2.0.0
```
**Trigger**: Complete rewrite of TDD methodology or removal of core responsibilities

### Minor Version Update
```
# Software Engineer Agent Instructions v1.2.0
```
**Trigger**: Adding 6 Golden Rules for clean code (new feature)

### Patch Version Update
```
# Software Engineer Agent Instructions v1.1.1
```
**Trigger**: Fixing typos in the Golden Rules section
