- **Scalability and Performance Needs**: Can the infrastructure handle projected load and performance requirements?
- **Security and Compliance Requirements**: Does the infrastructure meet regulatory and security standards?
- **Cost Optimization**: Is the infrastructure stack cost-effective for the projected usage patterns?
- **Team Operations Expertise**: Does the team have experience with the default infrastructure technologies?
- **Disaster Recovery and Backup Needs**: Does the infrastructure provide adequate resilience and recovery capabilities?
- **Integration Complexity**: How well does the infrastructure integrate with the confirmed application stack?
- **Maintenance and Support**: What is the long-term operational overhead of the infrastructure stack?

#### **Alternative Infrastructure Considerations**

**When Multi-Cloud Strategy Is Beneficial:**
- Consider AWS for specific services (Lambda for serverless, RDS for managed databases)
- Evaluate Google Cloud Platform for data analytics and machine learning capabilities
- Assess hybrid cloud approaches for compliance or performance requirements
- Consider cloud-agnostic tools (Terraform, Kubernetes) for portability

**When Container Orchestration Needs Are Complex:**
- Consider Amazon EKS or Google GKE for advanced Kubernetes features

- Assess CircleCI or Travis CI for cloud-native CI/CD
- Consider specialized deployment tools (Spinnaker, ArgoCD)

**When Monitoring and Observability Are Critical:**
- Consider Datadog for comprehensive application monitoring
- Evaluate New Relic for application performance monitoring
- Assess Prometheus + Grafana for metrics and alerting
- Consider ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for log management

**When Security Requirements Are Stringent:**
